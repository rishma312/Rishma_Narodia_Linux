1. Grade Checker
Take a score as input and print the grade based on the following:
90+ : "A"
80-89 : "B"
70-79 : "C"
60-69 : "D"
Below 60 : "F"
here we used a basic if else statement to carry out marks and all.
Answer:
def calculate_grade(score):
    """  Takes a score (integer) as input and returns the corresponding letter grade.""" if score >= 90:										return "A"											    elif score >= 80:										    # This condition is only checked if score < 90, so it covers 80-89			 return "B"											  elif score >= 70:										     # This condition is only checked if score < 80, so it covers 70-79			 return "C"										                 elif score >= 60:										     # This condition is only checked if score < 70, so it covers 60-69			 return "D"											else:												    # This covers all remaining scores (Below 60)						 return "F"

# --- Example Usage ---
# 1. Take score input from the user
while True:											 try:											 user_input = input("Enter the score (0-100): ")						     # Convert the input to an integer								 score = int(user_input)									    # Simple validation for a typical score range						     if 0 <= score <= 100:									break												else:											 print("Please enter a score between 0 and 100.")					except ValueError:									print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")
# 2. Call the function to get the grade
grade = calculate_grade(score)
# 3. Print the result
print(f"\nScore: {score}")								print(f"Grade: {grade}")

2 Student Grades
Create a dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are their grades. Allow the user to:
Add a new student and grade.
Update an existing student’s grade.
Print all student grades.

Used dictionary and basic operations. Using if else:

# Initialize the dictionary to store student names and grades
student_grades = {"Alice": "A", "Bob": "C", "Charlie": "B"}
def display_menu():
    """Prints the main menu options."""
 print("\n--- Student Grade Manager ---")

3.Write to a File
Write a program to create a text file and write some content to it.			Using file functions like write and open.
Answer :
def create_and_write_file(filename, content):
    """Creates a text file and writes content to it.
    :param filename: The name of the file to create (e.g., "my_document.txt").
    :param content: The string content to write into the file.
    """
    # 1. Open the file in 'write' mode ('w'). 
    # If the file does not exist, it will be created. 
    # If the file exists, its contents will be overwritten.
    try:
        with open(filename, 'w') as file:
            # 2. Write the content string to the file
            file.write(content)  
        # 3. Print a success message
        print(f"✅ Successfully created and wrote to the file: **{filename}**")
        print(f"Content written:\n---\n{content}\n---")
    except IOError as e:
        # Handle potential errors, such as permission denied
        print(f"❌ An error occurred while writing to the file: {e}")
# --- Example Usage ---
# Define the file name and the content
file_name = "sample_output.txt"
file_content = """
This is the first line of content.
This line was written using the file.write() function in Python.
The 'w' mode ensures the file is created or completely overwritten.
"""
# Call the function to execute the file operation
create_and_write_file(file_name, file_content.strip())

4. Read from a File
We used open in read mode and file.read to read and print to display.
Answer :
# --- Setup: Create a file to read from ---
# In a real scenario, this file would already exist.
# We use 'w' (write mode) here only to ensure the file is ready for reading.
setup_filename = "read_sample.txt"
initial_content = "Hello, Python File Reading!\nThis is the content you are about to read using file.read().\nReading files is essential for data processing."
with open(setup_filename, 'w') as f:
    f.write(initial_content.strip())
print(f"✅ Setup complete: Created **{setup_filename}** for reading.")
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
def read_and_print_file(filename):
    """
    Opens a file in read mode ('r'), reads its content, and prints it.
    :param filename: The name of the file to read.
    """print(f"\n--- Reading Content from **{filename}** ---")
    # 1. Open the file in 'read' mode ('r'). 
    # The 'r' mode is the default, so it's sometimes omitted, but it's good practice to include it.
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            # 2. Use file.read() to read the entire content of the file 
            # as a single string and store it in a variable.
            content = file.read()
            # 3. Print the content
            print(content)
        print("---------------------------------------------")
        print("✅ File reading complete.")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"❌ Error: The file **{filename}** was not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
# --- Execution ---
read_and_print_file(setup_filename)
